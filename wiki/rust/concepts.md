# Rust Concepts


## Ownership
`Rust has a unique approach to memory management: it's ownership system. It's a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. It's a way to manage memory without a garbage collector.`

## Monomorphization
`Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.`
