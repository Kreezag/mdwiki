## Temporal platform Concepts

`Activity` - is a normal function or method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), 
such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message. 
Activity code can be non-deterministic. We recommend that it be idempotent.

`Workflow` - is a program that coordinates multiple activities and other workflows.
A Workflow Definition in TypeScript is a regular TypeScript function that accepts some input values.

`Worker` - is a process that hosts one or more activity and/or workflow implementations.

`Task Queue` - is a logical grouping of activity and/or workflow tasks.
